# HAR_Mobile

This is an open dataset for human activity recognition (HAR) obtained from a mobile device and tagged manually. It contains four activities carried out by four subjects. Specifications of the dataset are the following:

Activities and time duration (each subject performed each activity three times):
1. Jumping   -- 2 minutes per subject
2. Walking   -- 5 minutes per subject
3. Laying-on -- 5 minutes per subject
4. Running   -- 5 minutes per subject

Sensors (built-in of the mobile device) involved in the measurements:
1. Accelerometer        -- X,Y,Z axes
2. Gyroscope            -- X,Y,Z axes
3. Magnetic Field       -- X,Y,Z axes
4. Linear Accelerometer -- X,Y,Z axes

Profile of the subjects (age/gender/height/weight):
1. 22 /  male  / 1.85m / 75kg
2. 28 / female / 1.57m / 49kg
3. 55 /  male  / 1.75m / 75kg
4. 29 / female / 1.68m / 54kg

Technical specifications of the mobile device:
- Model:                            Huawei NXT-L09
- Processor:                        HiSilicon Kirin 950
- Memory:                           32GB internal with 3GB RAM
- Battery:                          Li-Po 400mAh
- Application for data acquisition: Sensorstream IMU+GPS V1.0
- Sampling Frequency:               5Hz
- Storage Media:                    internal memory

Settings of activity performance:
1. All activities were perfoemd in a plain terrain with dimension 7 x 5 meters-squared
2. The mobile device was located at the left pocket of the subjects' pants in vertical position
3. This dataset has missing values
